LAB2
kevin O'Neil, Garret Mcdonnell, Aleks Drobnjak

Print function was modified to be able to print characters to the screen or a virtual printer
This was done by using a while loop and sending one character down to the assembly code function
per loop

Print function was then abandoned in favor of assemble code interrupt function all function calls 
were replaced with interrupt function in order to comply with lab.

Verification
You can verify this lab works by running the compileOS.sh script. This will build the assembler and 
kernal as well as tar it up for you...

then proceed to run bochs and you should get the bochs logo on the screen, and a hello world from 
the printer.out function
